                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>A real-time audio-video streaming and transcription platform built for the Misty II robot. The project establishes a continuous media pipeline using FFmpeg, streams audio and video output to a client, and integrates speech-to-text processing to enable live captioning and voice interaction.
                    I worked on this project during my time at the Human-Robot Interaction lab at UChicago, where it was to be used in a study that was researching the effect that a robot lecturer would have on a child's ability to learn social-emotional learning in a group setting.

                <h2>Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dual-Speaker Conversational Intelligence
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Implements audio localization and adaptive dialogue flow to allow Misty to identify, track, and respond to two students at once. The system determines who is speaking and orients Misty's body and head accordingly, enabling natural turn-taking and maintaining engagement with both participants.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>AI-Powered Speech Recognition & Dialogue Generation
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Integrates Rev.ai for real-time transcription and OpenAI/Gemini for language generation, enabling Misty to understand student speech and respond contextually. Supports SEL-focused dialogue, question answering, and spontaneous conversation rather than pre-scripted behaviors.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Social-Norm Monitoring & Intervention Logic
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Detects moments where conversation patterns suggest interruptions, rudeness, or off-task behavior. Misty can gently intervene, redirect discourse, or mediate conflict, demonstrating awareness of social context and providing a foundation for future autonomous SEL facilitation.
