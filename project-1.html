                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>DevSimplified is an interactive platform designed to make problem-solving visual, intuitive, and interview-ready.
                    We combine real-time algorithm visualization with AI-powered mock interviews to help learners bridge the gap between theory and real-world interview performance.
                    In collaboration with 4 other students (one of which, worked with me on the algorithm visualization) Dev Simplified was submitted to the UChicago tech showcase where it won the People's Choice Award in competition with 10+ other teams.

                <h2>Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Dynamic Code-to-Visual Sync
                        <ul>
                            <li>Users write code (e.g., DFS, Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford) in an embedded IDE, and the system animates the algorithm (e.g., node traversal, distance updates) in real-time to match their implementation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Interactive Graph Algorithms Guide
                        <ul>
                            <li>A structured walkthrough of fundamental graph algorithms such as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, and more. Each algorithm includes a visual explanation and small examples to build intuition before diving into implementation. Designed to help users understand the logic step-by-step rather than just reading code.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Fully Customizable Graph Builder
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create graphs tailored to your experiments by freely dragging nodes, adjusting edges, and shaping layouts in real time. Use the dropdown menu to instantly switch between preset structures (like trees, circular graphs, directed graphs, etc.), providing a flexible environment for learning, testing, and visualizing algorithm behavior.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>(I only worked on this feature breifly) Interactive AI Tutor (Chatbot Sidebar) 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Users can ask questions mid-execution (e.g., “Why is this node visited first?”), and the AI explains each step, suggests optimizations, and provides pseudocode comparisons, with difficulty tiers ranging from Beginner (BFS, Sorting) to Advanced (DP, Graph Theory)</li>
                        </ul>
